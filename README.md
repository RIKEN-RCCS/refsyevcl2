# refsyevcl2 - Iterative refinement for symmetric eigenvalue decomposition

These are the codes presented at ``15th Workshop on Latest Advances in Scalable Algorithms for Large-Scale Heterogeneous Systems`` held in conjunction with ``SC24: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis``.

The functions provided here are based on the algorithms proposed in Yuki UCHINO's Ph.D. thesis.
